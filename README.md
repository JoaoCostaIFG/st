# My build of **suckless's st**

This build includes some patches (sources are inside **'patches'** folder) and personal configurations in the **'config.h'** file.  
The **'colors-st.h'** file has my theme configuration for **st**.  
Bellow are the contents of the original README file from **suckless**.
